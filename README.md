# Advent of Code (AoC) 2015

This is where I post my solutions to the 2015 challenges on
http://adventofcode.com

Most challenges were solved using TDD for the component functions with a thin
`func main` to generate my final answers for the given input.

For each day I include a `README` that outlines the puzzle, the two
objectives, my solutions, and a summary of my approach to the problem.
